\title{Initialize shinyStore in an application's UI}
\usage{
initStore(id, namespace, privateKey = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{id}{The identifier of the store (determines the
  name of the store on the \code{input} reactive object
  in your \code{server.R} file).} \item{namespace}{Not a
  \code{namespace} in the traditional R sense, but rather the
  identifying prefix to use when storing any object in the
  browser's local storage. This is the only means by which we
  can separate data stored for different applications that are
  being hosted at the same (sub-)domain.} \item{privateKey}
  {the private key to use to decrypt data. Must be provided if
  you're going to have any encrypted fields.}
}
\description{
Though shinyStore doesn't have any user-visible elements,
you still must initialize it in your application's
\code{ui.R} file. You should execute this function in your
ui.R file to setup the input element associated with your
store.
